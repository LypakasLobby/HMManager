# A quick explanation of what this default template file is going to do:

# For the sake of the example scenario, we will say that this is a X Cut tree (so it checks the player's X-coordinate when it is clicked on), located at X=100.
# If the player clicks on this tree, and if the player's X-coordinate is <=99 (remember, the tree is at X=100) then the player needs to get teleported to the OTHER side of the tree
# However, if the player approaches the tree from the other direction, making their X-coordinate >=101
#       (because, remember, the tree is at X=100 and so because the TREE is at X=100 the PLAYER can't possibly be - unless standing on the tree, which defeats the whole purpose of this)
#       and they click on the tree, then they would get teleported to the OTHER side of the tree

# This effectively recreates the Cut HM outside of battle, without actually removing the tree because on multiplayer servers that's kinda bad because Player A with Cut could remove Cut trees
#     for Player B that has not yet unlocked Cut, enabling them to get to areas that they would have not yet unlocked the ability to go to, breaking progression
